# Handguster-recognition
This project presents a real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System that leverages Computer Vision and Deep Learning to identify and classify various hand gestures
The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for robust gesture classification and integrates image processing for preprocessing captured frames. This project involves a systematic pipeline to perform hand gesture recognition. The steps include data collection, image preprocessing, model training, and real-time testing.
